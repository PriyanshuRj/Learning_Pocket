### _Dive into the world of mechanics_
The project revolves around deciphering free body diagrams, interpreting all the forces acting on it and imparting steps to further solve the problem.  The idea emerged out of solving complex physics problems, especially by NEET or JEE aspirants. Our programme will help these aspiring students to get solutions of convoluted problems at an instance. This will act as a knowledge booster for an average student for whom hesitation is a stumbling block which devoids him/her to get the doubts clear from the mentor.

## Approach to Solution
Step 1 : We will scan the image and try to differentiate the type of problem.
<br>
Step 2 : We identify the shapes, text and diagrams.
<br>
Step 3 : We make a class for every shape and assign it its mass and then store the force, with the angle at which the force is applied.
<br>
Step 4 : We will resolve the forces into two axes and then form equations
<br>
Step 5 : We will solve the equation with the help of numpy.
<br>
Step 6 : Open CV is used for object detection

## Social Problem we Tackle
Unstirred by  the fact of the financial crisis due to prevailing Covid times, we do not want this pandemic to deter the students' knowledge in any way. Our website will act as a completely free concept builder for such aspirants. In fact, most of the mechanics problems go wrong just because the person is unable to draw a correct free body diagram. So, this is also an initiative to brushen-up the basics and get a fool-proof concept to solve any complicated problem.

## Future Scope
1. Can solve other problems of classical physics involving hydrodynamics,oscillation and wave,electrical circuits and logic gates and many more.
2. Act as a virtual mentor to the children who don't have the resources.
3. We also aim to solve problem including complex mathematics.
4. Include track progress for students to keep a record of time and number of problems they solve per day.
